          <!-- start paragragh -->

         <p>
            Hitchcock was born on 13 August 1899 in the flat above his parents' leased grocer's shop at 517 High Road, Leytonstone, on the outskirts of East London , the youngest of three children: William Daniel (1890-1943), Ellen Kathleen ("Nellie") (1892-1979), and Alfred Joseph (1899-1980). His parents, Emma Jane Hitchcock (née Whelan; 1863-1942), and William Edgar Hitchcock (1862-1914), were both Roman Catholics, with partial roots in Ireland; His father was a greengrocer, as his grandfather had been.

            Describing himself as a well-behaved boy—his father called him his "little lamb without a spot"— Hitchcock said he could not remember ever having had a playmate. One of his favourite stories for interviewers was about his father sending him to the local police station with a note when he was five; the policeman looked at the note and locked him in a cell for a few minutes, saying, "This is what we do to naughty boys". The experience left him, he said, with a lifelong fear of policemen; in 1973 he told Tom Snyder that he was "scared stiff of anything ... to do with the law" and wouldn't even drive a car in case he got a parking ticket.

            Hitchcock enrolled in engineering and navigation on July 25, 1913. In the book Cinema according to Hitchcock in 1962, he told Francois Truffaut that he studied mechanics, electricity and navigation. On September 12, 1914, his father, who suffered from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , died at the age of 52, and he also worked as an employee of the technical department in a telegraph company to support his mother and sister, and at the same time attended night classes in the fields of The history of art, painting, economics and political science goes, and his older brother also ran the same shop as his father.
